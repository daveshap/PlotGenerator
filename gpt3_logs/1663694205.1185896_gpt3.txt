One day, while she is out diving, she comes across a strange object floating in the water. It turns out to be a pod containing a sleeping man. Aqua takes the man to her home and nurses him back to health. The man, who introduces himself as James, is from the 21st century. He explains that he was a scientist working on a time travel experiment when something went wrong and he ended up in Aqua's time. Aqua is fascinated by James and his stories of the future. The two of them begin to develop feelings for each other. However, James is not the only one from the future who has ended up in Aqua's time.
