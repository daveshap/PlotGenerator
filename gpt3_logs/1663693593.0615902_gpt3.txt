Imagine a detailed plot outline for the following story:

STORY: Orphaned as a young girl, Johanna was taken in by her uncle, a wealthy merchant in the bustling city of Amsterdam. Growing up, she was always aware of her lower station in life, and felt awkward and out of place among the other young ladies of the city. She was content to live a quiet life, helping her uncle in his business and caring for her elderly aunt. One day, her uncle received a commission to transport a valuable cargo of spices and other goods to the Far East. Realizing that this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, Johanna begged him to take her along on the voyage. After much convincing, he finally relented, and Johanna set off on the adventure of a lifetime. On the long journey, Johanna slowly came out of her shell, finding friends among the crew and enjoying the excitement of life at sea. She also developed a deep bond with the captain of the ship, a kind and honorable man who treated her with respect and soon came to think of her as a daughter. When they finally reached their destination, Johanna was sad to say goodbye to her new friends and begin the journey back home. But she was also excited to return to Amsterdam and share her experiences with her aunt and uncle. Back in Amsterdam, Johanna settled back into her old life, helping her uncle in his business and caring for her aunt. She regaled them with tales of her adventures, and they were both proud of how she had grown during the journey. One day, a new commission came in for her uncle: he was to transport a group of wealthy nobles to the New World. Johanna immediately begged to go along, and her uncle eventually agreed. On the voyage, Johanna quickly realized that the nobles were a different breed than the friendly crew she had sailed with before. They were arrogant and dismissive, and she soon found herself at odds with one of the lord's sons, a sneering young man who seemed to take delight in making her uncomfortable. Despite her initial misgivings, Johanna eventually came to enjoy the journey, and even found herself attracted to the lord's son. But just as they were nearing their destination, a violent storm struck, putting the ship in danger of sinking. In the chaos, Johanna was separated from the rest of the group, and found herself washed ashore on a deserted island... Johanna was terrified at first, believing she would never be found and would have to spend the rest of her life alone on the island. But she soon realized that she was not alone: there were other survivors of the shipwreck, including the lord's son. At first, they were all resentful of each other, but as they began to work together to build shelter and find food, they slowly started to bond. Johanna and the lord's son soon developed feelings for each other, and they swore to find a way off the island and return to Amsterdam. After weeks of scouting and searching, they finally found a small boat that they could use to escape. They set sail for home, and arrived back in Amsterdam safe and sound. Johanna's aunt and uncle were overjoyed to see her, and the young couple soon announced their engagement. They would live happily ever after, their trials and tribulations having only made them stronger.
