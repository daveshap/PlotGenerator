Imagine a detailed plot outline for the following story:

STORY: A young boy living in Scandinavia is constantly teased and bullied by his classmates for being different. His parents tell him that he is special and has unique gifts that will one day enable him to help others, but he doesn't believe them. One day, after being particularly cruelly teased, he runs away from home into the forest. He is soon lost and cold, and regrets his decision to run away. As night starts to fall, he sees a light in the distance and walks towards it. He comes across a small cabin in the woods and knocked on the door. An old man answers the door and invite him in. The old man tells the boy that he is a wizard and has been expecting him. The boy doesn't believe him and is skeptical, but the old man shows him some amazing magic tricks that prove he is telling the truth. The old man tells the boy that he has been chosen to become the next great wizard of Scandinavia and has to start his training immediately. The boy is hesitant at first, but then agrees. The next few years are filled with rigorous training as the boy learns to control and use his magical powers. He also learns about the long history of wizards in Scandinavia and the battles they have fought against the forces of evil. One day, the boy's teacher tells him that he is ready to face his destiny and that there is a great evil brewing in the world. The boy sets out on his own to stop the evil, using all the skills and knowledge he has acquired. The boy quickly discovers that the evil he is up against is far greater than anything he could have imagined. He is faced with powerful wizards, evil monsters, and treacherous traps. He does his best to defeat them, but is often outnumbered and outmatched. Despite the odds, he never gives up and continues fighting for what is right. Slowly but surely, he starts to make progress and starts to turn the tide against evil. As the boy grows older, he becomes a powerful wizard in his own right. He leads the charge against evil, often putting his own life at risk. He faces many challenges and defeats many enemies, but the fight is never easy. Nonetheless, he never falters in his quest to protect Scandinavia and the world from evil. After many years of fighting, the boy finally defeats the evil wizard who has been leading the forces of darkness. With peace restored, the boy settles down and starts a family of his own. He remains a powerful force for good in the world, and his legend lives on for generations to come.
