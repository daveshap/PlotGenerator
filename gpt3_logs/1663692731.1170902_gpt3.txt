Imagine a detailed plot outline for the following story:

STORY: In present day Italy, an elderly man named Salvatore looks back on his childhood with fondness. He remembers a time when his town was teeming with life and excitement. One particular memory stands out to him: the day he got his pet dog, Benito. Salvatore was out playing with his friends when he spotted a scruffy little dog standing on the edge of the town square. He cautiously approached the dog and held out his hand, expecting to be bitten. But to his surprise, the dog licked his hand and wagged his tail. Salvatore's friends were apprehensive, but Salvatore was immediately drawn to the dog and convinced his mother to let him keep him. He named the dog Benito after the great Italian leader, Benito Mussolini. Benito quickly became Salvatore's best friend. Wherever Salvatore went, Benito followed. He even slept at the foot of Salvatore's bed. Salvatore loved taking Benito for walks around the town and showing him off to his friends. One day, when Salvatore was out walking with Benito, they came across a group of boys who were bullying a smaller boy. The boys were calling the smaller boy names and pushing him around. Salvatore immediately stepped in and ordered the boys to stop. The boys didn't take kindly to being told what to do and turned their attention to Salvatore. They began to bully him and call him names. But Benito didn't hesitate to defend his friend. He jumped at the nearest boy and bit him. The boy yelped in pain and ran away, followed by his friends. Salvatore was amazed at how brave Benito had been. From that day on, he knew he could always count on his loyal friend to have his back. The two spent many happy years together until, one day, tragedy struck. Benito tragically died while saving Salvatore's life. A tears streamed down Salvatore's cheeks as he recounted the story to his listeners. Even though so many years had passed, he could still clearly remember his beloved dog and the special bond they shared.
