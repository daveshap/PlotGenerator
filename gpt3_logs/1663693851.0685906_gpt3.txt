Imagine a detailed plot outline for the following story:

STORY: The story begins in Japan during the Iron Age. Our protagonist, a young girl named Aiko, is living a relatively normal life with her family. However, her normalcy is shattered when her village is invaded by a rival clan. Aiko's parents are killed and she is taken captive. But rather than being broken by her ordeal, Aiko manages to escape and flees to the forest. There, she stumbles upon a hidden group of people who have also been displaced by the war. This group, led by a wise and kind woman named Maya, take Aiko in and protect her. Aiko begins to train with the group, learning how to defend herself and others. As she grows older, she becomes one of the group's most skilled warriors. But her peaceful existence is once again interrupted when the clan that took her captive track her down. Aiko is forced to face her demons and fight for her life. In the midst of the battle, Aiko is seriously injured. But she manages to defeat her enemies and finally has the chance to return to her rightful home. However, upon her return, she finds that her village has been completely destroyed. Aiko is heartbroken but she knows that she must keep going. Aiko decides to join Maya and the others in their quest to create a new home. They travel across the country, encountering many challenges along the way. But eventually they find a suitable location and begin to build their new home. Life is not easy, but the group manages to create a thriving community. Aiko grows into a strong and confident woman, and she is respected by all who know her. But she still has nightmares about her past, and she knows that she will never truly be at peace until she takes revenge on the clan that destroyed her village. Aiko sets out on her own, determined to find the clan that took her captive. She tracked them down to their hidden fortress and prepares to attack. But before she can strike, she is captured by the clan. Aiko is taken before the clan's leader and is given a choice: join the clan or die. Aiko knows that she cannot join them, but she also knows that she cannot let them kill her. She makes a split-second decision and chooses to jump off the cliff instead. As she falls, Aiko remembers all the people she has loved and lost. She knows that she is sacrificing her own life, but she also knows that this is the only way to save her friends and ensure that the clan never harms anyone ever again. Aiko closes her eyes and accepts her fate.
