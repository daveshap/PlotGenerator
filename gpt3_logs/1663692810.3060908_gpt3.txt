But despite his antics, the people of Daiping love Jia. One day, when Jia is out playing near the river, he finds a small, shiny object. He doesn't know what it is, but he takes it home with him. Later that night, Jia shows the object to his best friend,Li. Li is a curious boy and he is immediately fascinated by the object. He asks Jia where he found it. Jia tells him that he found it near the river. Li is excited by this news and he asks Jia to take him to the spot where he found it. The next day, Li and Jia go to the river. They search around for the object but they can't find it. They do find a few more objects however, and they take these back to the village to show the other villagers. The villagers are excited by the objects and they ask Jia and Li where they found them. Jia and Li tell them about the river. The villagers are fascinated by the river and they decide to explore it. They find many more objects and they begin to build a boat to travel down the river. As the boat is being built, Jia and Li explore the river further and they find an entrance to a cave. They go into the cave and they find a secret underground world. This world is full of magical creatures and wonders. Jia and Li are amazed by what they see and they can't wait to tell the other villagers about their discovery. The villagers are amazed by the underground world and they decide to move there.
