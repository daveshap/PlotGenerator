Imagine a detailed plot outline for the following story:

STORY: In the distant past, long before the rise of civilization, the world is a very different place. The land is fertile and rich with resources, but the people who inhabit it are primitive and have only the most basic of technologies. Life is hard, but the people manage to make do. One day, a group of hunters goes out into the wilderness in search of food. They are successful in their quest, but as they are making their way back to their village, they are attacked by a group of wild animals. The hunters manage to kill the animals, but not before they suffer some serious injuries. One of the hunters, a young man named Hyrkanus, is gravely wounded in the attack. His friends carry him back to the village, but it is clear that he will not survive. Hyrkanus knows that his time is limited, and he asks his friends to take him to see the great pyramids of Egypt before he dies. The pyramids are an awe-inspiring sight, and Hyrkanus is filled with wonder at the engineering feats that they represent. He asks his friends to tell his people that he died happy, and then he passes away. Hyrkanus's story is passed down through the generations, and over time, the people of his village begin to forget about him. But his legacy lives on in the form of the great pyramids, which continue to stand as a testament to the power of the human spirit. As the centuries pass, the world changes. Civilizations rise and fall, and the pyramids become buried in the sand. But they remain, waiting to be rediscovered by a new generation. ONE DAY, a group of archaeologists is exploring the Egyptian desert, and they come across the long-lost pyramids. They are amazed by their find, and they begin to excavate them. As they work, they uncover more and more of the secrets that the pyramids hold. They also begin to piece together the story of Hyrkanus, and how his dying request led to the construction of these magnificent structures. The archaeologists continue their work, and they eventually restored the pyramids to their former glory. In doing so, they also breathe new life into the story of Hyrkanus, and his legacy is once again remembered. The story of Hyrkanus and the pyramids is now known all over the world, and they continue to stand as a testament to the power of the human spirit. No matter how big or small, we all have the ability to make a lasting impact on the world.
