Imagine a detailed plot outline for the following story:

STORY: In a time before recorded history, the world was a very different place. The land was ruled by powerful magical creatures and the humans who lived among them were often little more than their slaves. One of these humans was a young woman named Alaria who dreamed of one day being free from the yoke of her masters. One day, Alaria was out swimming in the sea when she was attacked by a large and ferocious sea monster. She fought back with all her might and eventually managed to kill the creature. From its carcass, she retrieved a magical stone that allowed her to breathe underwater. This stone would change her life forever. Using her new powers, Alaria began to explore the underwater world and quickly discovered that she was not the only one with magic. She met other humans with similar abilities and together they formed a secret society dedicated to freeing themselves and all humans from the tyranny of their masters. For years, Alaria and her fellow rebels fought against their oppressors, using their powers to strike back at those who sought to enslave them. They had many successes, but also suffered many defeats. As the years passed, Alaria became one of the most powerful members of the rebel group. She was fiercely dedicated to the cause and would do whatever it took to see freedom for all humans. One day, the rebels received a tip that a group of humans were being transported to a nearby island where they would be sold into slavery. Alaria and a team of rebels went to rescue them, but they were ambushed by the slavers. In the ensuing battle, Alaria was gravely wounded. The rebels were able to defeat the slavers and rescue the humans, but at the cost of Alaria's life. Alaria's death was a blow to the rebel group, but her sacrifice spurred them on to continue the fight for freedom. In her honor, they began teaching others the ways of magic so that one day all humans might be free. And so the legend of Alaria, the first rebel and freedom fighter, was born. Many years later, her story is still told to those who wish to learn the ways of magic. And her memory continues to inspire those who fight for freedom.
