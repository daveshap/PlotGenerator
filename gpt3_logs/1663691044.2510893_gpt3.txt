Imagine a detailed plot outline for the following story:

STORY: In the year 2300, the human race has colonized the moon. Life is harsh and difficult on the barren, airless satellite, but the inhabitants have made the best of it, creating a thriving community. One of the most important aspects of life on the moon is religion. The moon is home to people of all faiths, and religious belief is an important part of the community. One day, a group of religious extremists from Earth arrives on the moon, intent on causing havoc. They begin attacking the religious leaders of the community, and quickly start a full-scale riot. The community is plunged into chaos. In the midst of the chaos, a young woman named Sarah emerges as a leader. Sarah is a devout Christian, and she begins to rally the other religious leaders of the community together in an effort to restore order. With her help, they are able to calm the unrest and begin to rebuild. However, the religious extremists are not yet finished. They launch a series of attacks on the community, using powerful weapons. The community is soon on the brink of destruction. Sarah and the other leaders must find a way to stop the extremists before they destroy everything they've worked so hard to build. Sarah and the other leaders devise a plan to lure the extremists out into the open. They offer them a large sum of money, and the extremists agree to meet them in a remote location. Sarah and the leaders take a small group of soldiers with them to the meeting place. The extremists arrive, heavily armed. They demand the money, and Sarah and the others hand it over. However, this was all a trap. As soon as the extremists have the money, the soldiers open fire. The extremists are taken by surprise and are quickly captured. With the extremists in captivity, the community is finally able to begin to heal. Sarah and the other leaders help to rebuild the community, and life slowly returns to normal. The extremists are put on trial for their crimes. They are found guilty and sentenced to life in prison. Sarah and the other leaders continue to help the community to rebuild and thrive. The experience has brought them closer together, and they are determined to make the moon a better place for everyone. The community is stronger than ever, and life on the moon is better than it has ever been. Thanks to Sarah and the other leaders, the people of the moon have a bright future ahead of them.
