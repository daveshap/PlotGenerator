STORY: In the small town of Padova, Italy, in the year 1485, life is about to change forever for one young girl. Caterina da Padova is just sixteen years old, but she is already a skilled archer and a talented musician. She has a bright future ahead of her, and she is deeply in love with her childhood sweetheart, Lorenzo de' Medici. However, when Lorenzo is suddenly betrothed to another girl, Caterina's world is turned upside down. She is devastated, and her heart is broken. She throws herself into her music, trying to lose herself in the beauty of the melodies. One day, while she is playing her lute in the town square, she catches the eye of a handsome stranger. He is Diego, an assassin who has come toPadova on a mission. Caterina is intrigued by him, and she can't help but be drawn to his dangerous persona. Despite her better judgment, Caterina begins to secretly meet with Diego. She is drawn to his darkness, and he seems to understand her pain. As their relationship deepens, Caterina starts to realize that Diego is not the only one with a dark past. She starts to wonder if she can really trust him. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Caterina, Lorenzo is having second thoughts about his engagement. He can't get Caterina out of his mind, and he starts to regret his decision to marry someone else. He starts to wonder if he could ever be happy with anyone but her. As the wedding day approaches, Caterina is torn. She knows she needs to stay away from Diego, but she can't deny her feelings for him. At the same time, she can't bear the thought of Lorenzo marrying someone else. She doesn't know what to do. On the day of the wedding, Caterina makes a decision. She can't let Lorenzo marry someone else. She interrupts the ceremony and declared her love for him. Lorenzo is shocked, but he quickly realizes that he feels the same way. They get married there and then, much to the dismay of Lorenzo's family. Caterina is now a wife and a mother, but she can't forget about Diego. She still has feelings for him, and she can't help but wonder what could have been. Meanwhile, Diego is getting increasingly restless. He is bored with his job and he longs for excitement. Then, one day, he gets a new assignment. He is to kill Caterina's husband, Lorenzo. Diego doesn't want to do it, but he knows he has to. Caterina is married now, and she is off-limits. He can't have her, so he might as well take away the one thing she wants most. He hatches a plan and, on the night of the assassination, he sneaks into the Medici palace. He finds Lorenzo in his bedchamber and he kills him. Caterina hears the commotion and comes running, but it's too late. Diego disappears into the night, and Caterina is left heartbroken and alone. She swears to get revenge on the man who took away the only thing she ever loved. Caterina spends the next few years of her life consumed by her quest for revenge. She becomes a skilled assassin herself and, eventually, she tracks down Diego. She kills him, and she feels a sense of satisfaction. However, after she takes Diego's life, Caterina is left with a empty feeling. She realizes that revenge is not the answer. It cannot bring back the husband she loved so deeply. Caterina decides to leave her old life behind and start anew. She moves to a new town and starts a new family. She is finally able to find happiness again.
