Imagine a detailed plot outline for the following story:

STORY: In a time long ago, in a land of legend and magic, there was a great kingdom ruled by a wise and just king. All was well in the kingdom, until one day a strange and evil force began to stir. This force took the form of a dark wizard, who spread his evil influence throughout the land. The king and his knights were powerless to stop the wizard, and soon the kingdom was in great peril. In desperation, the king consulted with the wise men and women of the kingdom, and they advised him to seek out the help of a great hero who lived in a far-off land. The king set out on a long journey, and after many difficulties, he finally found the hero. The hero agreed to help the king, and together they set out to defeat the evil wizard. Meanwhile, the wizard had cast a spell of darkness over the kingdom, and the people were living in fear. But the wizard's power was not absolute, and there were still pockets of resistance. A group of brave warriors, led by the king's daughter, set out to find the heroes and help them defeat the wizard. The heroes and their allies fought bravely against the wizard and his forces, and eventually they were able to drive him back. But the wizard was not ready to give up, and he soon returned with an even larger army. This time, the heroes were not able to defeat him, and the wizard took control of the kingdom. The king and his daughter were captured, and the wizard imposed his will on the people. He forced them to worship him as a god, and they lived in fear of his power. But the heroes had not given up. They continued to fight the wizard, and eventually they were able to rescue the king and his daughter. With the help of the brave warriors, they were also able to defeat the wizard and drive him out of the kingdom. The kingdom was saved, but at great cost. The heroes had paid a heavy price, and many had lost their lives. But the people were free, and they soon began to rebuild their lives. The king and his daughter ruled wisely and justly, and the kingdom prospered. The people lived in peace and harmony, and the land was once again a place of beauty and wonder. The wizard was never seen again, but his evil influence was felt for many years. The people were careful to guard against his return, and they lived happily ever after.
