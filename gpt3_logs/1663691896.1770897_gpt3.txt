Imagine a detailed plot outline for the following story:

STORY: Life used to be normal. People went about their days without a care in the world. But then, everything changed. Suddenly, there was a new threat in the world. A group of aliens came to Earth, seeking to conquer it. They had technology that was far beyond anything that humans had ever seen before. The aliens were able to quickly gain control of the planet. They ruthless killed anyone who dared to oppose them. For the first time in history, humanity was facing extinction. But there was still hope. A group of rebels rose up to fight against the aliens. They quickly realized that they were outmatched and outgunned. There was no way that they could win in a traditional fight. So, they had to get creative. They came up with a plan that would use the aliens own technology against them. They would need to put their lives on the line to make it work, but it was their only chance. The rebels put their plan into action. At first, it seemed like it was going to work. They were able to take down several of the aliens ships. But then, the aliens fought back. They adapted and began to counter the rebels attacks. The tide of the battle quickly turned against the rebels. There was only one chance left. The rebels had to launch an all-out assault on the aliens mothership. It was a suicide mission, but it was their only hope of defeating the aliens. The rebels made their way onto the mothership. They were outnumbered and outgunned, but they fought with everything they had. In the end, they were successful. They were able to destroy the ship and kill the aliens. But at a great cost. Nearly all of the rebels were killed in the assault. Humanity was saved, but at a great price. The few remaining rebels tried to rebuild humanity. They did their best to try to bring peace and stability to the world. But it was a long and hard road. There were many who disagreed with the rebels. They saw them as nothing more than murderers. They were unwilling to forgive them for the innocent lives that were lost in the war. But the rebels persevered. They knew that it was the only way to ensure that humanity would never again be in danger of extinction. And so, they continued to fight. They continued to sacrifice. They would do whatever it took to protect humanity. They were the last line of defense against anything that threatened the planet. And they would never give up.
