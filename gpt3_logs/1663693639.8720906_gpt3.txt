Imagine a detailed plot outline for the following story:

STORY: In the early years of the twentieth century, America is in the midst of great social and economic change. New ideas and technologies are transforming the country, and society is beginning to question long-held beliefs. In the midst of this turmoil, a group of artists known as German Expressionists emerge, their work characterized by intense colors, stark images, and dark themes. One of the most famous Expressionist artists is Henry Miller, whose paintings reflect the horror and violence of the times. Miller is commissioned to paint a mural for a wealthy business owner, but the businessman is less than thrilled with the results. He demands that Miller repaint the mural, but the artist refuses. Infuriated, the businessman hires a gang of thugs to beat Miller and destroy his studio. Determined to get revenge, Miller begins to plot the businessman's downfall. He starts by seducing the man's wife and daughter, then framing him for a crime he didn't commit. As the businessman's life unravels, Miller revels in his handiwork, feeling that he has finally gotten even for the attack on his studio. As the businessman's life continues to unravel, Miller's own mental state begins to deteriorate. The lines between reality and fantasy start to blur, and Miller finds himself increasingly obsessed with the mural he painted for the businessman. He starts to believe that the mural is a portal into another world, and that if he can just find the right combination of colors, he can step through it and escape into this other realm. Miller's obsession starts to take over his life, and he grows increasingly detached from reality. His family and friends start to worry about him, but they're unable to get through to him. Finally, they staged an intervention, but it's too late; Miller has already descended into madness. Driven by his obsession, Miller finally completes the mural. But instead of leading to another world, the portal only leads to darkness and emptiness. Miller steps through, and is consumed by the void. His family and friends can only stand by and watch as he disappears into the infinite nothingness.
