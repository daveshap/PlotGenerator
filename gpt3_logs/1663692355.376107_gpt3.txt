Imagine a detailed plot outline for the following story:

STORY: When young gunslinger Cairo Shinshiro is orphaned at the age of eight, he's taken in by the town sheriff of Daken, a small desert town in the outskirts of Egypt. Cairo grows up tough and wild, but with a heart of gold. He quickly learns the ways of the gun and proves to be a natural sharpshooter. As he gets older, Cairo starts to get into trouble with the law. Sheriff Daken tries to keep the young man on the straight and narrow, but Cairo is headstrong and doesn't always heed the older man's advice. Finally, when Cairo is eighteen, Sheriff Daken throws up his hands in frustration and kicks the young man out of his home. Cairo is forced to make his own way in the world. He finds work where he can, but nothing seems to stick. He's not cut out for a life of hard labor. The only thing he's really good at is shooting a gun. One day, Cairo hears about a gang of outlaws who are terrorizing the nearby town of Nefertiti. The gang is led by a ruthless woman named Salma. Salma is said to be a sorceress, and it is rumored that she has the power to control the minds of her victims. Cairo decides to go to Nefertiti and see if he can put an end to Salma's reign of terror. He knows it won't be easy, but he's not afraid to take on the challenge. Cairo arrives in Nefertiti and quickly realizes that the situation is even worse than he thought. Salma and her gang have the town completely under their control. The townsfolk are terrified of the outlaws, and no one is willing to stand up to them. Cairo starts asking around, trying to find someone who knows where Salma is hiding out. Finally, he meets a young woman named Mehmet. Mehmet is one of Salma's victims. She's been under the outlaw's spell for months, and she's desperate to be free. Mehmet tells Cairo that Salma is holed up in an abandoned temple in the desert. She also tells him that the only way to defeat the sorceress is to find the magical Sword of Nefertiti. The sword is said to be cursed, but Cairo is determined to find it. Cairo sets out into the desert, searching for the temple. He's not sure what he's going to find when he gets there, but he's ready to take on whatever challenge Salma throws his way. Cairo finds the temple and confronts Salma. He's not afraid of her magical powers, and he's determined to put an end to her reign of terror. The two engage in a fierce battle, but eventually Cairo comes out victorious. He frees Mehmet and the other victims of Salma's spell and brings them back to Nefertiti. The town celebrates Cairo's victory, and he quickly becomes a folk hero. He decides to settle down in Nefertiti and starts a new life. He eventually marries Mehmet and they have a family of their own. Sheriff Daken hears about Cairo's victory and is proud of the young man he once took under his wing. He visits Nefertiti, and the two men reconcile. They share a drink and reminisce about the old days. Cairo Shinshiro is finally at peace. He's found a place where he belongs and he's made a difference in the world. He knows that the fight isn't over, but he's ready to take on whatever challenges come his way.
