Imagine a detailed plot outline for the following story:

STORY: It is ancient Asia, and misery lit is the genre of story being written. The setting is in a large and sprawling metropolis, where there is a constant ebb and flow of people and energy. The time period is one of great antiquity, and the rise and fall of empires is afoot. The story type is one of world-building, and the author is creating a highly detailed and immersive imaginary world with its own history, languages, geography, and cultures. The pace of the story is intensifying, and the characters are becoming more and more spirited as the book goes on. The tone of the story is gross and disgusting, with lots of yucky, oozy, and gross details that may be educational or purely for entertainment. The style of the story is stream of consciousness, portraying the uninterrupted and uneven flow of the characters' consciousness. The plot of the story follows the main character, a young woman named Misery, as she tries to make her way in the world. She is constantly surrounded by misery and despair, but she persists in trying to find moments of joy and happiness. She meets a man named Asia, who is also trying to find his way in the world. They become friends, and Misery starts to feel like she might finally have found a place where she belongs. However, Misery's world is turned upside down when Asia is killed in a senseless act of violence. Misery is left completely alone in the world, with no one to turn to and no one to help her. She is lost and adrift, and she starts to spiral into a deep depression. Misery starts to withdraw from the world, and she stops leaving her apartment. She becomes a hermit, living off of the bare minimum and barely scraping by. She loses all interest in life and just wants to curl up and die. One day, she is visited by Asia's ghost. He tells her that she needs to keep living, for his sake. He tells her that she has to find a reason to keep going, even if he is no longer there. Misery decides to start writing again. She starts to write a new story, one that is full of hope and happiness. She writes about a world where Asia is still alive, and they are able to be together. She writes about a world where they are able to find happiness and love. As she writes, Misery starts to feel better. She starts to feel like she has a purpose again. She starts to see that there is still beauty in the world, even if Asia is no longer in it. Misery finishes her story, and she feels like a new person. She decides to start living again, and she slowly begins to reintegrate into society. She starts to make new friends, and she starts to date again. Eventually, she meets a man who reminds her a lot of Asia. They fall in love, and Misery finally feels like she has found happiness again. She knows that Asia would be happy for her, and she knows that he is watching over her from the other side.
