Imagine a detailed plot outline for the following story:

STORY: In a small town in Germany in the 22nd century, a group of religious leaders from various faiths have gathered to discuss the state of the world. They are disturbed by the reports of violence and intolerance that have been plaguing the planet for some time, and they believe that something must be done to stop it. They decide to send a group of people, representing the various religions, on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, in the hope that they can find a way to peace. The pilgrims are a diverse group, consisting of Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, and Buddhists. They are all of different ages, races, and backgrounds, but they are united in their desire to find a way to peace. They set out on their journey, and as they travel, they learn more about each other's faiths and about the world around them. They also begin to realize that the violence and intolerance that they have seen in the world is not just a problem for one religion or one country, but for all of humanity. As they continue on their journey, the pilgrims face many challenges, both from the outside world and from within their own group. There are those who see them as a threat, and who seek to stop them from finding a solution to the world's problems. But the pilgrims are determined to reach the Holy Land, and to find a way to peace. The pilgrims finally reach the Holy Land, but they find that it is not the peaceful haven they were hoping for. The world is still plagued by violence and intolerance, and the pilgrims are now faced with the task of finding a way to peace in a land that is steeped in conflict. As they search for a way to end the violence, the pilgrims come to realize that the only way to peace is through understanding and respect for all religions. They also realize that the solution to the world's problems must be found within each individual, and that it is up to each person to make the world a better place. The pilgrims return to their homes, having found a way to peace. They share what they have learned with the world, and they hope that their journey will inspire others to seek a similar path. The world is still far from perfect, but the pilgrims have shown that it is possible to find a way to peace, and to live in harmony with people of all faiths.
