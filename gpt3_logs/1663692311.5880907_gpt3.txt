STORY: The story begins in France, in a time long ago. A group of people are living in a Medieval-style city, and life is hard. The city is constantly under attack from another group of people, and the people are constantly having to defend themselves. One day, a small group of people from the city decides to take a risk and venture outside the city walls. They're not sure what they'll find, but they're hoping to find something better. They're not the only ones who have had this idea, and they quickly find themselves in danger. They're surrounded by people who want to kill them, and they're barely able to escape. They make it back to the safety of the city, but they're changed by what they've seen. They've seen the outside world, and they know that there's more out there than just their little city. They start to dream of a better life, and they begin to plan their escape. The group of friends starts to make preparations for their escape. They're collecting supplies, and they're making a plan. But the city is still under attack, and they're needed to help defend it. They can't just leave, not now. The city is finally breached, and the friends are forced to fight. They manage to drive the attackers back, but at a cost. Many people are killed, including some of the friends. After the battle, the friends are even more determined to escape. They can't stay in the city any longer, not after everything that's happened. They finally make their escape, and they're quickly intercepted by the people who had been attacking the city. They're taken prisoner, and they're brought to a strange new land. This new land is full of magic, and the friends are quickly thrown into a world of political intrigue. They're caught in the middle of a power struggle, and they're struggling to survive. The friends are finally able to escape from the people who had been holding them prisoner. They make their way back to the city, but they're changed by what they've seen. They've seen the outside world, and they know that there's more out there than just their little city. They start to dream of a better life, and they begin to plan their escape. The story ends with the friends making their escape from the city.
