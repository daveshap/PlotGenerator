Imagine a detailed plot outline for the following story:

STORY: In the 18th century, China is a land of opportunity for LGBTQIA individuals. They are able to live relatively open lives, especially in the bustling metropolis of Beijing. However, when the emperor's eclectic and eccentric son, Prince Kai, takes the throne, everything changes. Prince Kai is a power-hungry and manipulative leader who quickly makes enemies of the LGBTQIA community. He persecutes them, forcing many to go into hiding or to flee the country entirely. However, there is a resistance movement led by the daring and charismatic rebel Phoenix. Phoenix is determined to overthrow Prince Kai and restore freedom and equality for all LGBTQIA individuals in China. They rally others to their cause, including the skilled fighter Willow and the kind-hearted street urchin Sparrow. Together, they plot to take down Prince Kai and his regime. But Prince Kai is not going to give up without a fight. He has his own loyal followers, including the ruthless general Jade and the dragon Lady Silk. With the help of these and other allies, Prince Kai will stop at nothing to maintain his power and crush the resistance. The fate of China hangs in the balance as the LGBTQIA resistance tries to take down the oppressive regime of Prince Kai. The resistance movement gains momentum, as more and more LGBTQIA individuals join their cause. They stage daring and daring attacks against Prince Kai and his allies, but they are always just out of reach of victory. As the conflict escalates, the casualties on both sides mount. Willow is critically injured in a battle with Jade, and Sparrow is captured by Lady Silk and taken to Prince Kai's palace. Phoenix is devastated by the loss of their comrades, but they refuse to give up. They know that they need to rescue Sparrow and overthrow Prince Kai if they want to save China and the LGBTQIA community. But time is running out. Prince Kai is getting closer and closer to discovering the resistance's plans. If he succeeds, it could mean the end of the resistance - and of freedom and equality in China. With time running out, the resistance makes a desperate final push to rescue Sparrow and take down Prince Kai. They succeed in both, but at a great cost. Phoenix is killed in the battle, and Willow dies from their injuries shortly afterwards. Sparrow is the only one left alive of the original resistance leaders. They take up the mantle of leadership and vow to continue the fight for LGBTQIA rights in China. The story ends with Sparrow leading a new generation of rebels into battle, determined to achieve equality and freedom for all.
