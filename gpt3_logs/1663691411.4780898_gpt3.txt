Imagine a detailed plot outline for the following story:

STORY: In the year 395 AD, a great war erupted between the Roman Empire and the Persian Sassanid Empire. The war was fought across a great swath of the world, from North Africa to Europe and even into Asia. In the midst of this conflict, a small village in the Italian Alps was caught in the middle. The village, called Bard and located in the northwestern corner of the country, was a peaceful place that had managed to avoid the ravages of war. But when the Roman army descended upon it, the village was soon caught up in the fighting. For three years, the village was besieged by the Romans. The villagers did their best to defending their homes, but they were slowly being starved out. Then, in the year 398 AD, a new force arrived on the scene: the Visigoths. The Visigoths were a group of Germanic tribes that had recently been displaced from their homes by the Huns. They were looking for a new place to settle, and they saw the village of Bard as the perfect opportunity. The Visigoths quickly routed the Roman army, driving them out of the village. The village was saved, but at a heavy cost. Many of the villagers had been killed, and the village was left in ruins. But the Visigoths were not content to simply settle in the village. They wanted to take it over completely. The villagers, however, had other ideas. The village of Bard was quickly rebuilt, but the tension between the villagers and the Visigoths remained. For the next year, the two groups coexisted uneasily, with the Visigoths constantly trying to assert their authority. Then, in the year 399 AD, everything changed. A new army arrived on the scene: the Huns. The Huns were a fearsome force that had been sweeping across Europe, and they quickly defeated the Visigoths. The village of Bard was once again caught in the middle of a conflict. The Huns were not interested in settlement, however. They simply wanted to plunder and destroy. The village was quickly sacked, and its people were slaughtered. This time, there were no survivors. The village of Bard was wiped off the map, and its people were lost to history. Or were they? In the year 2015, a group of archeologists working in the Italian Alps discovered the remains of the village of Bard. They also found a series of strange artifacts: stones that appeared to have been carved with symbols that were unknown to them. The archeologists soon realized that they had made a remarkable discovery: the lost village of Bard, and the remains of its people. What happened to the village of Bard? Was it simply destroyed by the Huns, or was there something more to its story? The archeologists are determined to find out. And as they begin to piece together the story of Bard, they may just discover the truth behind one of history's greatest mysteries.
