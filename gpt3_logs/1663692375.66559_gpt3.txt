STORY: Kaitlyn is a young woman living in Australia in the far future. She's always been a bit of a loner, and she's always been drawn to the paranormal. She's never really believed in ghosts or vampires or werewolves - until she meets Luke. Luke is a vampire who has just moved to Australia. He's been living on his own for a while, and he's not really sure what he wants to do with his life. When he meets Kaitlyn, he's instantly drawn to her. Kaitlyn is equally drawn to Luke, and the two of them begin a passionate, intense affair. Kaitlyn knows that Luke is a vampire, but she's not scared of him. She's fascinated by him, and she's more drawn to him than she's ever been to any other man. But as their relationship deepens, Kaitlyn starts to realize that there's more to Luke than she realized. He's not just a vampire - he's a powerful, dangerous vampire who is involved in some very dark business. Kaitlyn is in over her head, but she's not willing to let Luke go. She's determined to help him, even if it means putting herself in danger. As Kaitlyn gets more involved in Luke's world, she starts to realize just how dark and dangerous it is. She meets other vampires, and she starts to see the violence and the darkness that they're capable of. She's also put in danger by Luke's enemies, and she's forced to face the fact that she could be killed if she doesn't help Luke. Kaitlyn is torn between her desire to help Luke and her own self-preservation. She knows that she's in over her head, but she can't walk away from Luke. She loves him, and she's determined to help him through whatever he's going through. Kaitlyn's involvement in Luke's world leads her to a confrontation with his enemies.
