Imagine a detailed plot outline for the following story:

STORY: In the ancient kingdom of Kush, life is hard. The land is dry and dusty, the sun is hot, and the people are poor. Despite the difficulties, the people of Kush have a sense of pride in their country and their culture. One of the most difficult aspects of life in Kush is the constant threat of war. The kingdom is constantly at war with its neighbors, and the people suffer greatly. Many are killed, and even more are left homeless and hungry. In the midst of all this suffering, there is one man who seems to have it all. His name is Kanda, and he is the king of Kush. Kanda is a ruthless ruler, and he will stop at nothing to keep his kingdom safe. He has a strong army, and he is not afraid to use it. Kanda is also a very ambitious man. He wants to expand his kingdom and make it the most powerful in all of Africa. To achieve this, he needs to conquer all of the neighboring kingdoms. Kanda is a brave and fearless leader, but he is also a very cunning and manipulative man. He is willing to use any means necessary to achieve his goals. One day, Kanda decides to launch a major offensive against one of his neighbors, the kingdom of Assyria. He knows that this will be a difficult and bloody war, but he is confident that he can win. Kanda's army is successful in battle, and they quickly conquer the kingdom of Assyria. The people of Kush are overjoyed, and they hail Kanda as a hero. Even though Kush is now the most powerful kingdom in Africa, Kanda is not content. He wants more. He sets his sights on the next kingdom, Egypt. The Egyptians are a powerful people, with a strong army and a rich culture. Kanda knows that conquering them will not be easy, but he is determined to try. Kanda's army is no match for the Egyptians, and they are quickly defeated. Kanda is captured and taken prisoner. He is brought before the Pharaoh, who is amazed by his audacity. The Pharaoh sentences Kanda to death, but he is spared at the last minute by the queen of Egypt. She takes pity on him and decides to spare his life. Kanda is sent back to Kush in disgrace. He is a changed man, and he is no longer the ruthless ruler he once was. Kanda's return to Kush is not welcomed by all. Some of the people see him as a failure, and they want nothing to do with him. Others, including his wife and children, are happy to see him. They forgive him for his past mistakes and they welcome him back into the family. Kanda is a different man now, and he is no longer interested in conquest. He only wants peace for his kingdom. He knows that this can only be achieved if the people of Kush are united. To achieve this, Kanda makes a decision that will change the course of history. He asks the queen of Egypt for her hand in marriage. She accepts, and the two kingdoms are united. Kanda and the queen rule Kush together, and they bring peace and prosperity to the land. The people of Kush are finally able to live in peace and harmony.
