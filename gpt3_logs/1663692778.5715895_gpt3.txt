The woman, who is named Vita, takes pity on the young girl and takes her in. Vita begins to teach Lia how to defend herself and how to fight. Lia slowly begins to heal from her trauma and starts to take an interest in her new life. As Lia grows older, she becomes an excellent fighter and catches the eye of a local chieftain. The chieftain, who is named Dante, asks Lia to join his personal guards and protect him. Lia agrees and quickly proves her worth, saving Dante's life on numerous occasions. Dante begins to see Lia as more than just a guard and starts to develop feelings for her.
