Imagine a detailed plot outline for the following story:

STORY: The story begins in America during the stone age. A large cast of characters are introduced, many of whom are of various Stone Age tribes. The reader learns that there is growing tension between the tribes, and that violence is a constant threat. One character, a young man named John, is of a peaceful tribe known as the Good Samaritans. John's tribe has always tried to stay out of the conflict, but when John's sister is kidnapped by a rival tribe, he sets out to rescue her. John quickly realizes that he is woefully unprepared for the task at hand, and resorts to seek help from a veteran warrior of the tribe, known as Bo. Bo is reluctant to help John, but after much persistence, he relents. The two set out on a dangerous journey to rescue John's sister. Along the way, they encounter various challenges and obstacles, both from the natural world and from the other Stone Age tribes. They also meets others who joins their quest, including a young woman named Sarah, who is also of the Good Samaritans. After a long and arduous journey, they finally reach the rival tribe's village. They find that the village is heavily fortified, and that getting in will be no easy task. They hatch a plan to sneak in under the cover of night, but their plan quickly goes awry, and they find themselves in the midst of a battle. In the midst of the fighting, John's sister is killed. Enraged, John lashes out and kills her killers. This act of violence sets off a chain reaction, and soon the entire village is consumed by fighting. In the end, John and his companions are the only ones left alive. As they make their way back to John's village, they are all changed by the experience. John, in particular, is haunted by the violence he has witnessed and committed. These events will stay with him for the rest of his life, and he will never be the same again.
