Imagine a detailed plot outline for the following story:

STORY: It is the year 320 AD. The once great Empire of Rome is in ruins. The once mighty legions have been reduced to a shadow of their former selves. The once invincible legions have been defeated and driven out of Britain. The last remnants of the once great Empire are now camped out in a small town in the middle of nowhere in the province of Gaul. The people of the town are eking out a meager existence, trying to stay out of the way of the legions and the bands of marauding barbarians. Life is hard, but it is what it is. One day, a Stranger comes to town. He is a tall, dark-haired man with a scar on his cheek. He is wearing a strange set of armor that no one has ever seen before. The Stranger doesn't say much, but he seems to have a purpose. The Stranger is looking for someone. He is looking for a woman named Valeria. Valeria is a young woman who is living in the town with her mother and father. Valeria is a beautiful young woman, and she has caught the eye of the Stranger. The Stranger is not the only one who is interested in Valeria. There is also a Roman centurion named Marcus. Marcus is a career soldier who has been in the legions for many years. He is a good man, but he is getting old. Marcus is interested in Valeria because he wants to retire and settle down. Valeria is torn between the two men.
