Imagine a detailed plot outline for the following story:

STORY: When a young boy named Andy stumbles across a battered old broken-down ship in the middle of the woods, he has no idea that his life is about to change forever. Little does he know that this ship is actually an interdimensional vessel from another solar system, and that it contains a crew of mischievous pirates who have been stranded on Earth for centuries. Andy quickly befriends the pirates, and together they embark on all sorts of adventures. From pillaging local towns to attacking passing ships, no scheme is too daring for this ragtag band of scallywags. They'rerowdy and wild, and they take Andy along for the ride of his life. But as the pirates' antics start to attract too much attention, they realize that they need to find a way back to their own solar system before it's too late. With the help of Andy, they begin to piece together the shattered remains of their ship in the hopes of one day returning home. As the pirates work tirelessly to repair their ship, they often find themselves on the wrong side of the law. Their daring escapades have made them wanted men (and women), and the authorities are hot on their heels. But the pirates are nothing if not resourceful, and they always seem to stay one step ahead of the law. This gives them ample opportunity to continue their shenanigans, much to Andy's delight. During one of their many adventures, the pirates stumble upon a secret government laboratory deep in the forest. They soon discover that the laboratory is conducting experiments on children with special abilities, and that Andy is one of those children. The pirates quickly release all of the children from the laboratory, and they become like a family. They continue to repair their ship and evade capture, but their time is running out. One day, the pirates' ship is finally repaired, and they set sail for home. They say goodbye to Andy, promising to come back for him one day. As the ship disappears into the horizon, Andy is left behind with a new family who loves him and a sense of adventure burning in his heart.
