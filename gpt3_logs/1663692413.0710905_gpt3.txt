STORY: In a small village on the outskirts of a large kingdom, a young girl named Jena is born. Jena is born with a deformity that makes her body look twisted and her face ugly. Jena's parents are poor and can't afford to have her deformity corrected, so they do their best to hide her away from the world. Jena grows up knowing that she is different and that she will never be accepted by society. One day, when Jena is out looking for berries in the forest, she comes across a wounded bird. Jena nursed the bird back to health and decides to keep it as her pet. She names the bird Seren and Seren becomes Jena's only friend. One day, Jena's village is attacked by a group of bandits. Jena's parents are killed and her house is burned down. Jena manages to escape with Seren, but she is now alone in the world. Jena decides to go to the kingdom and find a way to make a living. On the way, she meets a man named Simon who agrees to help her. Simon is a skilled thief and he teaches Jena everything he knows. Together, Simon and Jena commit a series of daring heists in the kingdom. As their notoriety grows, they become known as the "Robin Hood" thieves.
