Imagine a detailed plot outline for the following story:

STORY: In the small town of Harrisonville, Ohio, the residents are struggling to get by. The economy has tanked and jobs are scarce. The town's only source of income is the coal mine, but the mine is on the verge of closing. In desperation, the town's mayor turns to a group of Chinese businessmen who have expressed interest in opening a factory in the town. The mayor is hoping that the factory will provide much-needed jobs for the town's residents. The Chinese businessmen agree to open the factory, but only if the town's residents are willing to work for very low wages. The town's residents have no choice but to agree.
