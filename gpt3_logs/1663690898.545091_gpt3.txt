It is a society that is very advanced and has access to technology that we can only dream of. The main character is a woman named Sarah.

They believe that they are meant to live under the sea and that it is their destiny. Sarah is undeterred and continues to work on a way to reverse the cataclysm. Meanwhile, the underwater society is met with another threat. A group of marauders, who call themselves "The piranhas", are attacking and plundering the underwater villages. They are a ruthless and brutal group who take what they want without regard for the consequences. Sarah and her team are able to find a way to reverse the cataclysm.
