The years pass and Amit languishes in his cell. He becomes bitter and angry at the world. But then one day he has a visitors. A young girl, who tells Amit that she is a descendant of the Egyptian royal family, has come to see him. The girl, whose name is Cleopatra, tells Amit that she has been studying magic and she believes that he can help her overthrow Augustus and take back Egypt. Amit is initially skeptical, but he is eventually won over by Cleopatra's passion and determination. Amit starts teaching Cleopatra everything he knows about magic. Together, they hatch a plan to overthrow Augustus. They begin to gather supporters and gain momentum. But then one day, their plans are discovered. Amit and Cleopatra are arrested and brought before Augustus. They are both sentenced to death. Amit and Cleopatra are brought to the public square to be executed. Amit goes to his death with his head held high, but Cleopatra is hysterical. She begging for her life and screaming that she is pregnant with Amit's child. Caesar Augustus is unmoved. He gives the order for Amit and Cleopatra to be killed. Amit is killed first. As he dies, he casts one last spell. A magical wind begins to blow, and Cleopatra's screams are drowned out by the sound of it. The wind grows stronger and stronger, until it becomes a whirlwind. It picks up Cleopatra's body and carries it away, until she is nothing more than a speck on the horizon. And that is the last anyone ever hears of Amit and Cleopatra.
