Imagine a detailed plot outline for the following story:

STORY: APPEAL TERMS: Cooking Stories, Korea, 23rd century, Religiously diverse, Intensifying, Stylistically complex, Steamy, Open-ended

BEGINNING: It is the 23rd century, and the world is a very different place. In Korea, a smaller and more densely populated country than it is today, the main form of transportation is by Maglev train. The cooking style of the country has also changed, relying heavily on what can be grown in vertical gardens and hydroponic farms.

One day, a young woman named Soo-min is on her way to work as a chef at a famous restaurant in the capital city of Seoul. She is from a small town and is not used to the hustle and bustle of the city. As she is waiting for her train, she notices a handsome man also waiting for the train. They make eye contact, and there is an instant spark of attraction between them.

At the restaurant, Soo-min's boss assigns her to the task of preparing a special dish for a very important customer. The customer is a religious leader from aNother country who is visiting Korea on a diplomatic mission. He has very specific and unique dietary requirements, so it is up to Soo-min to create a dish that will meet his needs.

To complicate matters further, she is also told that she must use only ingredients that are available in the country, which means that she will have to get creative.

MIDDLE:

Soo-min begins to experiment with different ingredients and combinations, but nothing seems to be working. She is becoming frustrated and is about to give up when the handsome man from the train station suddenly appears in the restaurant. He introduces himself as Kim Jong-un, and it turns out that he is the religious leader's personal assistant.

Jong-un asks to speak with Soo-min in private, and she agrees. He tells her that the religious leader is very important to his country, and if she can create a dish that he will enjoy, it would be a great boon to the relations between their two countries. Soo-min is suddenly motivated and inspired, and she gets to work on a new dish.

After much trial and error, she finally comes up with the perfect dish. The religious leader is very pleased, and the dinner is a great success. Soo-min is praised by her boss and Jong-un, and she feels a sense of accomplishment.

LATER:

As time goes on, Soo-min and Jong-un continue to see each other, and they eventually fall in love. They get married and have a child, and they live happily ever after.
