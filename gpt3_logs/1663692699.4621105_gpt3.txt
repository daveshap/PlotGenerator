Imagine a detailed plot outline for the following story:

STORY: In Japan, during the 15th century, there was great turmoil and unrest. Many sword and sandal stories take place during this time period, and this one is no different. Our story follows a group of characters who are all fighting for their own survival. The main character is a young woman named Kiku. She was born with a physical condition that makes her different from everyone else. Kiku is small and delicate, and she has always been treated differently because of her size. As a result, she has developed a hard, tough exterior. Kiku is fighting for her survival in a world that is often hostile to her. She is constantly faced with challenges, both physical and mental, that test her strength and resolve. But Kiku is a survivor. She is resourceful and clever, and she always finds a way to overcome whatever obstacles are in her way. The other main character is a man named Nobu. He is also fighting for his survival in this uncertain world. Unlike Kiku, Nobu was born into a wealthy and privileged family. But his life changed forever when his family was killed in a political Coup. Nobu was forced to flee for his life, and he has been on the run ever since. He is a skilled warrior, and he has been using his skills to protect those who cannot protect themselves. He is drawn to Kiku because he sees her strength and resilience, and he knows that she is someone who can help him in his fight. Together, Kiku and Nobu will face many challenges. They will be tested in ways that they never thought possible. But they will also discover that they have a common enemy: a powerful and ruthless warlord who is threatened by their growing alliance. The warlord will stop at nothing to destroy Kiku and Nobu. He will unleash his army of soldiers, and he will use every weapon in his arsenal to bring them down. But Kiku and Nobu are not alone. They have each other, and they have the strength of their convictions. They will not give up without a fight. Kiku and Nobu are inseparable now, and they are fighting harder than ever before. The warlord is getting desperate, and he is making one final, desperate push to destroy them. The warlord's army is closing in on Kiku and Nobu's location. They are outnumbered and outgunned, but they refuse to give up. Kiku and Nobu know that this is their final stand, and they are prepared to die fighting. The battle is brutal. Kiku and Nobu are fighting for their lives, and they are taking down as many of the enemy soldiers as they can. But eventually, they are surrounded and outnumbered. The warlord himself is there, and he is ready to kill them both. Just when it seems like all is lost, Kiku and Nobu are rescued by a group of friendly warriors. They are badly injured, but they are alive. Kiku and Nobu owe their lives to their new allies, and they are determined to repay the debt. Kiku and Nobu are finally safe, but the war is not over. The warlord is still out there, and he is more determined than ever to destroy them. Kiku and Nobu know that they cannot rest until the warlord is defeated. But in the meantime, they find solace in each other's company. Kiku and Nobu have been through so much together, and they have emerged stronger and more resilient than ever before. They are ready to face whatever challenges come their way, and they know that they can overcome anything as long as they are fighting together.
