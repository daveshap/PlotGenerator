Imagine a detailed plot outline for the following story:

STORY: Martin Freeman and his wife, Kate Winslet, live in a small town near the edge of the Pacific in the late 19th century. They have three young children, all of whom are daughters. Freeman is a carpenter and Winslet is a seamstress. One day, while Freeman is out working, a strange man arrives in town. He calls himself John Smith and says that he is a traveller. He is tall and thin, with a long white beard. He is wearing a black coat and has a strange device on his wrist. Smith begins asking questions about the town and its inhabitants. He is particularly interested in the Freemans. He says that he is looking for a place to stay and asks if they have a spare room. Winslet is hesitant, but Freeman agrees to let him stay. Smith quickly ingratiates himself with the family. He helps Freeman with his work and shares meals with them. He entertains the children with stories of his travels. The Freemans begin to trust him and invite him into their home and their lives. But then strange things begin to happen. Smith starts staying up late, tinkering with the device on his wrist. He suddenly has strange knowledge about things that he couldn't possibly know. And he seems to be able to influence people's thoughts and actions. As the townspeople start to become worried about Smith's strange powers, the Freemans begin to have doubts about him as well. Is he really the harmless traveller that he claims to be? Or is he something more sinister? As Smith's strange behaviour becomes more and more apparent, the Freemans start to fear for their safety. They begin to suspect that he is not who he claims to be. One night, they wake up to find him standing over their bed, staring at them. They confront him and demand to know who he really is. Smith finally admits that he is not a traveller. He is an alien from another planet. He says that he is a scientist and that he has been observing the townspeople for research. The Freemans are horrified and insist that he leave their home immediately. But as they try to eject him from their lives, they begin to realize that he has a hold over them. He has been using his powers to control them. They start to suspect that he is not the only one of his kind and that there are others like him in the town. They realize that they are in danger and that they need to find a way to stop him. With the help of the townspeople, the Freemans finally manage to drive Smith out of their lives. But they are left traumatized by their experience. They realize that there are others like him out there and that they are in danger. They need to find a way to warn others about the threat that these aliens pose.
