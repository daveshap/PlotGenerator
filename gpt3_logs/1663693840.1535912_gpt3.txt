Imagine a detailed plot outline for the following story:

STORY: In 19th century Korea, best friends JIN and SUNG-MIN are inseparable. They are both orphans and have only each other to rely on. They make a living by going around to the different villages and begging for food and money. They are happy with their simple life and each other's company. One day, while they are in the village of Hwacheon, they witness a brutal murder. The victim is a young woman who is disemboweled and left to bleed to death in the streets. Her killers are a group of masked men who ride off on horseback. Jin and Sung-Min are horrified by what they have seen and decides to go to the nearest city, Seoul, to find the woman's family and tell them what happened. In Seoul, they are directed to the home of the woman's husband, KIM. He is a wealthy businessman who is very successful. When they tell him what happened, he is devastated. He was not home when his wife was killed and feels guilty that he could not protect her. Kim decides to find the men who killed his wife and get revenge. He hires Jin and Sung-Min to help him. They agree, and the three of them begin to track down the killers. The investigation leads them to a secret society that is involved in human trafficking. The society is run by a man known as the "Professor." The Professor is a ruthless and sadistic man who enjoys torturing and killing his victims. As they get closer to the Professor, they discover that he is planning to sell a young Korean woman, YU-MI, to a Japanese diplomat. Kim knows that if Yu-Mi is sold, she will be taken to Japan and likely never seen again. They devise a plan to rescue Yu-Mi and at the same time, bring down the Professor and his society. The plan is risky and dangerous, but with Jin and Sung-Min's help, Kim is able to rescue Yu-Mi and kill the Professor. In the aftermath of the rescue, Kim gives Jin and Sung-Min a large sum of money. He tells them to use it to start a new life. The three of them say goodbye, and Jin and Sung-Min leave for a new life, together. THE END
