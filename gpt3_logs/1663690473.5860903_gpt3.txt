Imagine a detailed plot outline for the following story:

STORY: Captain Jack Sparrow and his ragtag crew of pirates are blasting their way through space, plundering and pillaging any ship they come across. They're on the run from the authorities, and they're not slowing down for anyone. One day, they come across a seemingly abandoned vessel. They board it, only to find a team of highly trained soldiers waiting to ambush them. A fierce battle ensues, and the pirates are outnumbered and outgunned. Captain Jack Sparrow rallies his crew and fights back with all they've got. They eventually defeat the soldiers, but not before sustaining heavy losses. Captain Jack Sparrow and his crew are now wanted criminals across the galaxy. They're constantly on the run, and they're running out of places to hide. One day, they come across a mysterious planet that's surrounded by a strange meteor field. They decide to land on the planet and take their chances. As they explore the planet, they realize that it's inhabited by a race of advanced beings who are able to harness the power of the meteor field. They're able to use this power to make people's deepest desires come true. Captain Jack Sparrow and his crew are initially skeptical, but they eventually decide to give it a try. They each make a wish, and they're all granted their wishes. However, they soon realize that the planet is actually a trap, and that the beings who granted their wishes are actually enslaving them. They're able to break free and escape the planet, but they're left traumatized by the experience. Captain Jack Sparrow and his crew are back to being outlaws on the run. They've all been affected by their experience on the planet, and they're all struggling to deal with it in their own way. One day, they come across a distress signal from a nearby planet. They investigate and find that the planet is under attack by a race of beings who want to enslave the inhabitants. Captain Jack Sparrow and his crew team up with the planet's inhabitants to fight back. They eventually defeat the attackers, but not before sustaining heavy losses. After the battle, Captain Jack Sparrow and his crew go their separate ways. They're all changed by their experience, and they'll never be the same again.
