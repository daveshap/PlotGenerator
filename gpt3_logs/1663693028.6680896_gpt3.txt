Imagine a detailed plot outline for the following story:

STORY: A young woman, Cassiopeia, is living in a small town on the outskirts of a great kingdom. She is content with her life, until one day her world is turned upside down when she discovers her true identity. She is actually a princess, who was kidnapped as a baby and raised by commoners. When her real parents discover her, they take her back to the palace and she is thrust into a world of luxury and wealth that she is unfamiliar with. At first, she is overwhelmed by the opulence and grandeur of palace life, but she soon adapts and comes to love her new life. She makes new friends, including a handsome prince, and enjoys all the wonderful things that come with being a princess. But Cassiopeia's idyllic life is short-lived. The kingdom is soon invaded by a neighboring kingdom and they are quickly defeated. The palace is sacked, Cassiopeia is taken prisoner, and her parents are killed. She is taken to the neighboring kingdom, where she is forced to work as a servant in the palace. She is miserable, but she does not give up hope. One day, the prince of the neighboring kingdom, who is also her captor, comes to her and tells her that he is going to make her his queen. She is shocked, but she knows that she must go along with his plan if she ever wants to see her homeland again. Cassiopeia is taken to the neighboring kingdom and forced to marry the prince. She hates him, but she knows that she must play the role of the dutiful wife. She bides her time, waiting for an opportunity to escape. Meanwhile, the kingdom she once called home is in ruins. The surviving members of the royal family are in hiding, and the kingdom is struggling to survive. One day, Cassiopeia's chance comes. The prince is called away to war and she is left alone in the palace. She seizes the opportunity and escapes, making her way back to her homeland. She is welcomed with open arms by the remaining members of the royal family. They are overjoyed to have her back and they quickly begin to make plans to retake the kingdom. Cassiopeia leads the charge, leading her people into battle against the invaders. It is a bloody and brutal war, but in the end, Cassiopeia and her people are victorious. They drive the invaders out of the kingdom and reclaim their rightful place as the rulers of the land. Cassiopeia returns to her homeland a changed woman. She is experienced, battle-hardened, and wiser. She settles down and marries the prince, with whom she has fallen in love. They rule the kingdom together and live happily ever after.
