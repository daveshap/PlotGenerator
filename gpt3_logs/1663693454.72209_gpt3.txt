Imagine a detailed plot outline for the following story:

STORY: In a distant future, the world is a vastly different place. North Africa is a veritable paradise, a land of scorching sun and infinite sand. The people here are a proud and fierce race, united by a common love of violence. Theirs is a land of warlords and mercenaries, of blood and death. In this harsh land, only the strong survive. The weak are ruthlessly crushed. In the midst of this chaos, one man stands out. His name is Kalid, and he is the most ruthless and feared warlord in all of North Africa. Kalid is a man of dark ambitions. He seeks to conquer all of North Africa and build a vast empire. To this end, he has built up a massive army of warriors, which he leads with an iron fist. Kalid is a cold and calculating man, but he is also a man of great passion. He is driven by his love of power and his hatred of weakness. He will stop at nothing to achieve his goals. Kalid's quest for power leads him to the city of Cairo. Here, he clashed with the forces of the Pharaoh, a powerful ruler who controlled all of Egypt. In a brutal battle, Kalid emerged victorious. The Pharaoh was killed, and his army was routed. Kalid took control of Cairo and made it his capital. From Cairo, Kalid began to expand his empire. He quickly conquered all of North Africa. His next objective was to invade Europe. Kalid's army invaded Italy, but they were met with fierce resistance. The Italian forces were led by a remarkable general named Hannibal. Hannibal was a master tactician. He brilliantly exploited the weaknesses of Kalid's army. In a series of crushing defeats, Kalid's army was driven back to Africa. Kalid was not deterred by his defeat. He was more determined than ever to conquer Europe. He began to raise a new army, even larger and more powerful than before. Kalid's second invasion of Europe was even more brutal than the first. This time, he left a trail of death and destruction in his wake. The European armies were no match for his overwhelming force. One by one, the countries of Europe fell to Kalid. Finally, the only country left standing was Britain. The British forces were commanded by a woman named Boudicca. She was a fierce warrior, and she inspired her troops to fight with valor. Boudicca led the British army against Kalid's forces in a series of spectacular battles. But in the end, she was outnumbered and outgunned. The British army was defeated, and Boudicca was captured. Kalid's conquest of Europe was complete. He had become the most powerful man in the world. Kalid's reign of terror continued unabated. He grew more cruel and tyrannical with each passing day. The people of the world lived in fear of his wrath. Finally, a group of brave warriors decided to lash out against Kalid. They recruited Boudicca, who had escaped from captivity, to lead them. The coalition army marched against Kalid's forces. In a final, epic battle, they were victorious. Kalid was killed, and his empire was destroyed. The world was finally free from his tyranny. But the scars of his reign will remain forever.
