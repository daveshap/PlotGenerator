Imagine a detailed plot outline for the following story:

STORY: In the 14th century, in the country of Brazil, a young man named Johan decides to set out on an adventure. He has always been fascinated by stories of far-off lands, and he is determined to see the world for himself. His parents try to dissuade him, but they ultimately allow him to go. Johan sets sail from the port town of Rio de Janeiro, and he soon finds himself in the midst of a great storm. The ship is battered and nearly sunk, but Johan and the other survivors are able to make it to a small island. They are stranded there, with no food or water. Johan and the others search the island forresources, but they find nothing. The situation is desperate. Finally, they see a ship on the horizon. They wave and shout, but the ship does not see them. Johan knows that they will not survive if they stay on the island, so he builds a raft and sets out to sea. Johan is rescued by the ship and taken to the port of Lisbon. He is happy to be alive, but he is also disappointed that his adventure has come to an end so quickly. Johan spends the next few years in Lisbon, working as a sailor. He longs to go on another adventure, but he does not have the opportunity. One day, he hears about a treasure that is hidden in the jungles of Brazil. The story intrigues him, and he decides to go in search of the treasure. Johan begins his journey in Rio de Janeiro, but he quickly realizes that he is out of his depth. The jungle is dangerous and difficult to navigate. He is soon lost, and he nearly dies of starvation. Johan is finally rescued by a tribe of indigenous people. They take him in and care for him. He learns their language and their way of life. He also falls in love with a woman named Mara. Johan decides to stay with the tribe. He is happy there, but he cannot forget about the treasure. He decides to make one last attempt to find it. This time, he is successful. He finds a great treasure, but he is also bitten by a poisonous snake. Johan knows that he is going to die. He says goodbye to Mara and the tribe, and he dies contentedly, knowing that he has lived a good life. Johan's body is buried in the jungle. Mara and the tribe mourn his death, but they also celebrate his life. They remember him as a brave and determined man who always sought adventure.
