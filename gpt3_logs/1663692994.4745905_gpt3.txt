Imagine a detailed plot outline for the following story:

STORY: In the small town of Bethlehem, set in the hills of Judea in the first century, a young couple, Joseph and Mary, are expecting their first child. Due to the unrest in the region, they are forced to flee to Egypt. On the way, they encounter bandits who steal their donkey and threaten to kill them. They are saved by a group of Roman soldiers, led by a Captain named Lucius, who take them under their protection and escort them the rest of the way to safety. While in Egypt, Mary gives birth to a son, whom they name Jesus. As he grows, it becomes apparent that Jesus has special powers, which he uses to help those in need and to perform miracles. When asked by his disciples why he doesn't use his powers to save himself and his loved ones from suffering, Jesus says that he must fulfill his destiny and that his death will bring about a greater good. During the course of his ministry, Jesus makes enemies of the religious leaders of the day, who see him as a threat to their power. They eventually convince the Roman authorities to put him on trial for sedition. Jesus is convicted and sentenced to be crucified. Despite his peaceful nature, Jesus is angry and bitter at the injustice of his treatment and says some harsh things to his enemies as he is being crucified. As he dies, he forgives them, saying that he knows they don't understand what they are doing. After Jesus' death, his disciples are distraught and discouraged. They scatter and go into hiding. But after a few days, they have a vision in which Jesus appears to them and tells them to continue his work. They emerge from hiding and begin to preach his message of love and forgiveness to the world. And so the story of Christianity begins.
