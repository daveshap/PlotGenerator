3. Setup: The story begins with the appearance of a strange comet in the sky. Soon afterward, a strange new disease begins to afflict the colonists. The disease is strange because it doesn't affect the bodies of the colonists, but rather their minds. They begin to experience strange hallucinations and delusions.

6. Break Into Two: The scientist quickly realizes that the disease is caused by the strange comet that had appeared in the sky. The comet is, in fact, a Rogue Planet. A planet that had been ejected from its solar system and was now wandering through space. The planet was inhabited by a race of beings who were responsible for the disease.
