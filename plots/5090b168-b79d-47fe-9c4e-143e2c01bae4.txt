1. Opening Image: The year is 2134. The world is a far different place than it was just a century ago. Authoritarian governments have replaced democratic ones, and ideology has replaced reason. In this dark new world, the autonomous nation of France stands out as a beacon of hope.

2. Theme Stated: A haven for creativity and progress, France is a nation on the rise, its people united by a common love of liberty. But behind the scenes, a different story is unfolding. A story of intrigue, manipulation, and conspiracy. For there are those who believe that France's success is a threat to the status quo, and they will stop at nothing to ensure that the nation does not fulfill its potential.

3. Setup: As the conspirators work to undermine the nation from within, the people of France must band together to protect their liberty and their future.

4. Catalyst: The conspirators are undone by their own greed and arrogance, and the people of France triumph.

5. Debate: But the cost of victory is high, and the nation is left to rebuild in the aftermath of war.
