1. Opening Image: The opening image should establish the setting of Mars as a small, remote planet that is largely uninhabited. It should also introduce the small group of people who have made it their home, and establish their close-knit community.

2. Theme Stated: The theme should be stated as the importance of tradition in the community. This can be done through dialogue between the characters, or through narration.

3. Setup: The setup should introduce the annual Mars Cup race as the most important tradition in the community. It should also establish the reigning Mars Cup champion, John, as a young man who is determined to defend his title.

4. Catalyst: The catalyst for the story should be John's injury, which forces him to withdraw from the race.

5. Debate: The debate should be between John and the other members of his community. John will be debating whether or not to give up on his dream of winning the Mars Cup, and the other members of the community will be trying to convince him to keep going.

6. Break Into Two: John should break into two at this point, and decide to focus on recovering from his injuries.

7. B Story: The B story should be the community rallying around John and helping him to recover.

8. Fun and Games: The fun and games should be John's training for the race. He should be determined to come back stronger than ever and win the Mars Cup next year.

9. Midpoint: The midpoint should be John's trip to Mars' capital city to try to get some last-minute sponsors.

10. Bad Guys Close In: The bad guys should be the other competitors in the race. They should start to catch up to John near the end of the race.

11. All is Lost: John should start to tire near the end of the race, and it should seem like he is going to lose.

12. Dark Night of the Soul: John should have a moment of doubt at this point, but he should then find the strength to keep going.

13. Break Into Three: John should break into three at this point, and he should cross the finish line first.

14. Finale: The finale should be John's community being proud of him, and the prize money from the race helping his family.

15. Final Image: The final image should be John looking forward to next year's race, and being determined to defend his title once again.
